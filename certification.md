# Metronisys™ Certification Overview  
## Human-Centric AI Agent Governance & Alignment

> **Metronisys™** is a trademark of Tony Nudd.  
> This certification framework defines how AI agents, automation systems, and organizations demonstrate alignment with the Metronisys™ principles, decision boundaries, and governance standards.

---

## 1. Purpose of Metronisys™ Certification

The **Metronisys™ Certification Program** exists to ensure that AI agents and automation systems:

- Operate in alignment with **human wellbeing, identity, and sustainable performance**
- Respect **attention, energy, and agency boundaries**
- Provide **transparent, auditable, and explainable decision-making**
- Comply with emerging **AI governance expectations** (e.g. EU AI Act, ISO/IEC AI standards)

Certification provides a **trust signal** that an agent or system is *human-aligned by design*, not merely efficient.

---

## 2. What Can Be Certified

Metronisys™ certification applies to:

### A) AI Agents
- Autonomous or semi-autonomous agents
- LLM-based assistants
- RPA + AI hybrids (e.g. UiPath, Moltbot)

### B) Automation Systems
- Workflow orchestration platforms
- Decision engines
- Personal or enterprise AI copilots

### C) Organizations (Optional Tier)
- Companies deploying Metronisys-aligned agents at scale
- Platforms embedding Metronisys™ governance frameworks

---

## 3. Certification Levels

### 🟢 Level 1 — **Metronisys™ Aligned**

- Declared alignment with Metronisys™ principles  
- Human-in-the-loop safeguards present  
- Manual review of decision boundaries  

Suitable for:
- Early-stage products
- Personal AI tools
- Research and experimentation

---

### 🔵 Level 2 — **Metronisys™ Governed**

**Focus:** Enforcement & controls

- Decision boundaries actively enforced  
- Attention, energy, and identity guards operational  
- Logging and audit trails enabled  

Suitable for:
- Production AI agents
- Enterprise automation
- Regulated environments

---

### 🟣 Level 3 — **Metronisys™ Certified Agent**

**Focus:** Trust, auditability, and resilience  
- Full alignment with Metronisys™ manifesto and principles  
- Continuous monitoring and drift detection  
- Explainable decisions with traceable policy references  
- Regular compliance reviews and versioned policies  

Suitable for:
- Mission-critical systems  
- High-impact or high-risk AI use cases  
- Public or consumer-facing AI platforms

## 4. Core Certification Criteria

All certification levels are assessed against the following domains:

| Domain | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Principle Alignment** | Conformance to Metronisys™ principles |
| **Decision Boundaries** | Enforcement of explicit limits and guardrails |
| **Human Agency** | Clear escalation and override paths |
| **Transparency** | Explainable actions and decisions |
| **Auditability** | Logging, traceability, and version control |
| **Adaptability** | Ability to evolve without violating core principles |

---

| Capability | Required for Certification |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Human escalation | **Mandatory** |
| Budget enforcement | **Mandatory** |
| Tool call auditability | **Mandatory** |
| Cross-agent delegation integrity | Mandatory |

---

## 5. Evidence & Artefacts

Certification assessments may require:

- `principles_vX.Y.Z.md`
- `decision_boundaries_vX.Y.Z.md`
- Machine-readable policy files (YAML / JSON)
- Agent configuration and permission scopes
- Sample audit logs and decision traces
- Documentation of human override mechanisms

---

## 6. Relationship to Regulation & Standards

Metronisys™ certification is **complementary**, not competitive, with formal standards.

It is designed to:
- Map cleanly to **EU AI Act** requirements (risk, transparency, human oversight)
- Support **ISO/IEC 42001** and related AI governance standards
- Provide a *human-centric layer* above technical compliance

---

## 7. Certification Lifecycle

1. **Declaration** – Applicant selects certification level  
2. **Assessment** – Review of artefacts and enforcement mechanisms  
3. **Validation** – Alignment confirmed against Metronisys™ criteria  
4. **Issuance** – Certification granted with version and scope  
5. **Maintenance** – Re-certification upon major version changes  

---

## 8. Trademark & Usage

- Only certified systems may display the **“Metronisys™ Certified”** mark  
- Certification does **not** transfer trademark ownership  
- Certification may be revoked if principles or boundaries are violated  

See `TRADEMARK.md` for full usage terms.
